# Headphone Amplifier Using LM386

This project involves designing a headphone audio amplifier circuit using the LM386 low-voltage audio power amplifier. The amplifier boosts audio signals for use with headphones.

## Files in the Repository

- **`HeadphoneAmplifierUsingLM386.asc`**  
  LTspice simulation file to analyze the circuit's performance.
  
- **`HeadphoneAmplifierUsingLM386.brd`**  
  PCB layout file for the amplifier, which can be used to manufacture the circuit board.
  
- **`HeadphoneAmplifierUsingLM386.sch`**  
  Schematic diagram of the circuit showing all components and connections.

## Components Used
- LM386
- Resistors, capacitors, and other passive components.
- Headphone jack and connectors.

## How to Use
1. Open the **`.sch`** file in a schematic editor to view the circuit design.
